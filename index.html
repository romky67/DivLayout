            <p>Thus flower is a shoot bearing sporophyll. Flowering plants have successfully colonised land by reducing the water dependent gametophytic generation to the point where it is entirely protected within the sporophytic generation.</p>
            <br>

            <p> Typically flower is a condensed branch in which internodes have become condensed, bringing the nodes close to one another, and the leaves are modified to form floral whorls that directly or indirectly participate in the process of reproduction. Flowers differ considerably in size, shape, colour and arrangement of their parts, yet most of them bear a common structural plan.</p>
            <br>

               
                <p> Flowers are symbolic of beauty, love and tranquillity. They form the soul of a garden and convey the message of nature to man. Flowers and objects of aesthetic, ornamental, social, religious and cultural value.</p>
